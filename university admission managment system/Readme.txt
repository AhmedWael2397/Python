this is a simple University admission manager app to help add applicants to the system and make some analysis on them to identify accepted and rejected candidates depending on a basic points system with specific thresholds 

passing GPA threshold gives 3 points   
passing SAT threshold gives 3 points 
participating in any of mentioned student activities gives 1 extra point 

less than 3 points is considered rejected 
between 3 points and 6 points is considered in waiting list 
above 6 points is considered accepted   

and finally generates a report containing all applicants with their score and state if they're accepted / rejected / waiting listed
